# Stock Analysis Using VBA (VBA challange)
## Background
In this study stock of the green energy companies are studied. The main purpose of this study is to go over thourough the stock data for 2017 and 2018 to find out best profitable green company stock. The second purpose of this study is to improve the already existing code to increase the performance. These codes are explained in next section.
## Results
The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).

## Summary
There is always ways to improve a code. In this study we went through a process to improve a code that had an extra for loop and was going thorough the data several times. In general, one of the addvantages of refactoring is the possibility of having a faster code. The disadvantage is that by changing a working code, we might introduce a bug to the code and increase the amount of time that we should put on the code. This is a risk that we should accept to decrease the time needed to go thorough the data.

In the case of the present code, the old code was going through the data for each stock and it was a time consuming process. Increasing the database would have defiently increased our processing time a lot. By optimizing and refactoring the code we were able to reduce the time and optimize the code for larger data sets. There is no major disadvanatage for this code, and the only minor disadvantage is that the code is harder to undrestand by someone who is not familiar with the code and the data. This disadvantage can be solved by additional comments inside the code.
